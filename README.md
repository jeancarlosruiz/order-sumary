## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tools: Reset CSS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - This helped me reset my css styles to reduce browser inconsistencies. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [HSL to RGB color conversion](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/color/hsl-to-rgb.html) - This is an amazing tool which helped me convert my hsl color to a RGA one (I used it because I wanted to change the background opacity to the SVG only). I'd recommend it to anyone.

- [W3bits.com](https://w3bits.com/css-image-hover-zoom/) - This website basically helped me how to zoom the image in, just need to add a box which the image will zoom in with the transition in the image, I don't know if is the right way but it worked.
